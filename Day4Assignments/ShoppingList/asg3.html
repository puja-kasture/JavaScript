    <h1>Assignment 3</h1>
    <h3>Imagine you are going out to do some grocery shopping. <br>
        So you have an array called shoppingList with all the products you want to buy. <br>
        Now that you are inside of the shop, you have a basket with all the products from your list, but you want to
add a few more. <br>
        Create a new array called shoppingBasket, that will be a copy of the shoppingList array, and add some
new products into it.
